## Assumptions

If there are images in local storage the folder "Untitled Folder" will be visible with the existing images, otherwise nothing will be displayed.

## Pending User Stories

4. As a user, I can move images between folders. An image can only be in one
folder at a time.
6. (Optional) As a user, I can rename folders

## Future improvements

- When the user selects an image from the folder tree view, display the image
- Show error message on input validation when `Add button` is clicked
- Improve design
- Improve accessibility
